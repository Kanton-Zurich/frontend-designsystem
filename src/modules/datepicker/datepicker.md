Datepicker

### Integration

The datepicker module has a few relevant aspects in terms of configurations via the data attributes:

- data-datetimeformat

Possible valid string values: 
1. "time" -  plain timepicker variant
2. "date" -  plain datepicker variant
3. "date-range" -  datepicker for selecting a range(from/to)
4. "date-time" -  datepicker for selecting a plain date combined with a time

- data-daylabels

Normaly the labels are in english. If you want to customize the labels put them there. But 
*allways starting with sunday* and seperate each day via space like: "So Mo Di Mi Do Fr Sa"

- data-mindate

If set, it initialized the plugin with the give date as minimum selectable date

- data-maxdate

If set, it initialized the plugin with the give date as maximum selectable date
